## Description 
A simple game made using Pygame, based on the 1976 game "Breakout".
The game increases in difficulty after every level and ends when the player loses 5 lives.

## Features
- This game consists of 8 rows and 9 columns of bricks, a ball, and a player paddle.
- The ball bounces off the paddle, the bricks, and the top, left and right of the screen.
- Every time the ball touches a brick, the brick disappears and the score increases.
- If the ball touches the bottom of the screen, the player loses a life.
- After 5 lives, there is a game over screen, showing the players final score.
- The game can be played again by pressing 'ENTER' on the game over screen.
- If the player clears all the bricks, they get a bonus to their score,  
a new level begins with a higher difficulty.
